A meta-learning model for regression on noisy data with outliers

This work was initially started in 2017 while working with a large scale
noisy regression problem. The initial experiments were one in R and abanoned
when I moved onto other projects. The same line of thinking recurred in 2021
as I looked at more regression problems and led to this repository.

This time round the implementation will be in Python in a SKLearn compatible
structure. Thanks to the contributors at SK-Lego for the inspiring open-source
library that informed much of the development you will see here.


### Installation

The package will be released via PyPi and can installed via pip.
